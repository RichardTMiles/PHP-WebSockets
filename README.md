HTML 5 Websockets written for PHP
This includes the ws:// and wss:// protocol. Simplistic and to the point. I saved you the run around of digging through other repos or learning spec. This is strictly for the order of operations in a procedural script. Complexities are guaranteed to exist for any specific use case.

# PHP-RFC - https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/14047

This repo was used to initially develop and test `apache_connection_stream` which would allow websockets though Apache CGI without any server configuartion. Historically a websocket request must be setup by running a PHP-CLI script that starts a server to then accepts connections on a specific port. 

# Starting the WebSocket
## PHP-CGI apache2handler

Running the full apache version currectly requires you build the PHP interpreter from source, specifically the branch used for [this pull request](https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/14047). I have a [2024 Gist for Mac Users](https://gist.github.com/RichardTMiles/ebf6ce2758bf3f11469d25463092465a). Note: many tutorials exist. If the proposal becomes standard compilation will no longer be nessasary. You have two options for running:
- `php -S localhost:8888 index.php`
- Add this project to your Apache web root. It is assumed that Apache is set to serve `index.php` as the default request, which would be the assumed behavior on an Apache PHP enabled server. Both requests (HTTP GET, and HTTP Upgrate WebSocket) will have the appropriate headers returned. The Upgrade request will persist as expected while the GET request will terminate after the HTML data is served.

**Note:** Either of the CGI implimentations, aka ways to run listed above, are actually implemted diffrently in `C` code. It is much better and more powerful to run this example in `Apache` as the `PHP` server context is single threaded and thus unable to run on multiple browsers at a time.

## PHP-CLI
Running the PHP WebSocket server is done using the following commands in two seperate shells.

- `php index.php`
- `php -S localhost:8888 index.php`

This will allow you to visit the chat demo on your local web browser.

### CLI Server caviates 
To setup this process in an Apache WebServer you will need the `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_wstunnel` modules installed. You can then add the following directive to your `.htaccess` files. Note: htaccess overrides will need to be enabled.

```
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} Upgrade [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/?(.*) ws://127.0.0.1:8888/$1  [P,L,E=noconntimeout:1,E=noabort:1]
```

This will cause apache to proxy all requests to the PHP WebSocket server. If SSL is handled through Apache then it will be handled in the proxy as well, meaning you will not need to configure certificates in you PHP WebSocketserver as HTTPD will translate WSS to WS in the background. 

## navigates to php's built in webserver
`open http://localhost:8888/`   

^ Throw a star up there!
